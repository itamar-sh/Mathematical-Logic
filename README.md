# Mathematical-Logic-for-Programming-_Course_67501
Via code we can infer and prove any mathematical problem.

## Propositions
We declare Formula, Operator, InferenceRule, Proof.

With those tools we advance to define Axioms and use them to prove some logic rules like deduction rule.

## Predicates
Using advance ideas of the raw concepts in Propositions we definde TQBF as Formula.

With the better tools we were able to prove syllogism, Russel and even The Completness Theorem of Godel.
